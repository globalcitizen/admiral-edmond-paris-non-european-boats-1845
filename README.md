# *Essai sur la construction navale des peuples extra-europ√©ens, ou, Collection des navires et pirogues* (ca. 1845)

This classic work, produced circa 1845 by Admiral Edmond Paris and published by the French Naval authority of the period, discusses traditional naval construction methods of non European peoples, covering Africa, Arabia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia and the Pacific including Micronesia, Melanesia, Polynesia and Alaska.

A beautiful work and perhaps something of a prelude to France's dominance in multihull design, it is organized in to two tomes.

 * The first is the written portion, or *essai*. Only very few pages are reproduced here.
 * The second are the image plates, or *atlas*. All pages are reproduced here.

## Notes

I became aware of the text through reading *[Wind Tunnel Measurements of the Performance of Canoe Sails from Oceania](http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_123_2014/Volume_123,_No._1/Wind_Tunnel_Measurements_of_the_Performance_of_Canoe_Sails_from_Oceania,_by_Anne_Di_Piazza,_Erik_Pearthree_and_Francois_Paille,_p_9-28/p-6)* which was published in 2014 and presents a more specific update to Marchaj's classic work *Sail Performance*. The authors mentioned that they culled traditional rig designs from this work, notably for the most efficient *Santa Cruz* design.

In January 2020 I photographed the pages (on a regular smartphone) for research purposes, and present it here for the benefit of others. It is not super high resolution, nor are the plates perfectly flat (in order to prevent damage). However, they should be clear enough to be of utility to anyone analyzing the images for historical research purposes.

Enjoy.


## Possible future work

I had a concept of measuring the various design elements in a bid to match the objective hull, rudder, rig and sail design properties to local sea and voyaging conditions. Such a project would be based on this work and realised as a data file in this repository. Should you wish to begin or contribute, feel free to dive right in and create an issue or pull request!
